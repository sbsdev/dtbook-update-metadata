A tiny xml transformer that will update the meta data in your DTBook
file and only that. No entity expansion, no anything! You get your
original xml file back with the updated meta data.

* Installation
Clone and build with

#+begin_example
mvn clean package
#+end_example

** Versioning
The maven build uses the [[https://github.com/qoomon/maven-git-versioning-extension][maven-git-versioning-extension]] which will
label the build artifacts accordingly. In order for this to work you
will have to tag the source and checkout this tag before building (see
https://github.com/qoomon/maven-git-versioning-extension#configure-extension).

* Usage

#+begin_example
java -DTITLE="New Title" -jar update-dtbook-metadata-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar original.xml > updated.xml
#+end_example
